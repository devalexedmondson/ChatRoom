# ChatRoom
C# application: TCP Chat room that works on Design patterns, dependency injections, and TCPclients. 
1. Single Responsibility Principle was used in my StartServer method. This method starts the server and then moves on with the rest of the program. 
2. Dependency Inversion Principle was used in my server class. My server class does not depend on any other classes to run but their cohesion is still high while the coupling stays low.
